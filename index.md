# Welcome to the 57North Archive

This is a static file set in github, accessed via github pages.  There are a few things here, we may add more over time.  Each archived system lived in a sub-directory of this.

This can be used as a static file store for systems that are achived, or anything reasonably static like that.

## Mailing List Archive [view>](https://andygaskell.github.io/57n-web-archive.github.io/mailing_list/)

There is a mailing list archive. All mailing lists are archived here, this is not an automated process, but a system for perhaps keeping old mailing list data when migrating to a new server, or that sort of thing.  The archive date is noted on the [index page](https://andygaskell.github.io/57n-web-archive.github.io/mailing_list/).


## Wiki, pre may 2020 [view>](https://andygaskell.github.io/57n-web-archive.github.io/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page.html)

There is a static copy of the Media Wiki based wiki. See [mediawiki](https://andygaskell.github.io/57n-web-archive.github.io/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page.html).  The MediaWiki based Wiki was replaced with DocuWiki in May 2020.
