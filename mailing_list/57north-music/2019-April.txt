Holash,

I'm off to see the rather excellent Tom McGuire & the Brassholes instead of Open tuesday on May 14th May at the Lemon Tree. Tickets are at [1]. It's a group with a strong funk and soul vibe from Glasgow - checkout bandcamp [2] for the album they're touring!

It should be good fun, they seem to have a sense of humour!
